This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning models.
The dataset includes features like Age, Gender, Ticket Class, and Fare, which were preprocessed and used for training classification models.
📊 Dataset
Source: Titanic dataset from Kaggle
Features used: Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare
Target: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
🛠️ Steps in the Project
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)
✅ Results
Achieved ~80–82% accuracy on test data
Random Forest performed the best
Gender and Class had strong influence on survival chances
